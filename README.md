# The Uncommon Byte

In 2022, after working as a developer for the last 10 years, and with the last 5 years being completely remote, I decided to start documenting things I encounter at work, tips to stay productive while working remote, tips on staying sane working remote, tips & tricks to make your life as a developer easier and just general development posts.

I intentionally made this public so you can use it as a template to start your own blog if you wish.

This blog is built and maintained by [Vincent](https://github.com/bytesbase).
